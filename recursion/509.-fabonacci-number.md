# 509. Fabonacci Number

### 1. [Description](https://leetcode.com/problems/fibonacci-number/)

The **Fibonacci numbers**, commonly denoted `F(n)` form a sequence, called the **Fibonacci sequence**, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from `0` and `1`. That is,

```text
F(0) = 0,   F(1) = 1
F(N) = F(N - 1) + F(N - 2), for N > 1.
```

Given `N`, calculate `F(N)`.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: 2
Output: 1
Explanation: F(2) = F(1) + F(0) = 1 + 0 = 1.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: 3
Output: 2
Explanation: F(3) = F(2) + F(1) = 1 + 1 = 2.
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: 4
Output: 3
Explanation: F(4) = F(3) + F(2) = 2 + 1 = 3.
```

**Note:**

0 ≤ `N` ≤ 30.



### 2. Solution

**Solution 1: Recursion**

        **** 4

        / \

      3    2

    / \     / \

  2   **1    1    0**

 / \

**1   0**

We could boil down the problem to calculate Fab\(n\) into 2 questions:

* Fab\(n - 1\)
* Fab\(n - 2\)

To get Fab\(n - 1\), we could continue to boil it down to Fab\(n - 2\) and Fab\(n - 3\)...

Until we hit the bottom line: Fab\(1\) = 1, Fab\(0\) = 0

So in general, it could be solved by recursion where

* base case: Fab\(1\) = 1; Fab\(0\) = 0
* recursive rule: Fab\(n\) = Fab\(n - 1\) + Fab\(n - 2\)

{% hint style="info" %}
* Time complexity: O\(n ^ 2\)

where n represents the given input n. Because it's dependent on the amount of tree nodes, which is further dependent on the amount of leaves.

* Space complexity: O\(n\)

Because the call stack of the recursion would be from n to 0.
{% endhint %}

**Solution 2: Dynamic Programming**



### 3. JAVA Implementation

3.2 Recursion

```text
public int fib(int N) {
    if (N == 0 || N == 1) {
        return N;
    }
        
    return fib(N - 1) + fib(N - 2);
}
```

3.2 Dynamic Programming

```text
public int fib(int N) {
}
```
