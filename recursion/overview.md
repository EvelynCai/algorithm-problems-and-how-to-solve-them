description: Recursion

# Overview

### Appearance

One function calls itself.

### Essence

boil down a problem of size n to subproblems of smaller size.

### Implementation

* base case: the smallest size problem
* recursive rule: how to make the problem smaller

### Graphic

recursion tree

* amount of tree nodes: time complexity \(furthermore, amount of tree leaves\)
* height of tree: space complexity

### Code

function signature should be the same and re-used.
