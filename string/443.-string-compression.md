# 443. String Compression

### 1. [Description](https://leetcode.com/problems/string-compression/)

Given an array of characters `chars`, compress it using the following algorithm:

Begin with an empty string `s`. For each group of **consecutive repeating characters** in `chars`:

* If the group's length is 1, append the character to `s`.
* Otherwise, append the character followed by the group's length.

The compressed string `s` **should not be returned separately**, but instead be stored **in the input character array `chars`**. Note that group lengths that are 10 or longer will be split into multiple characters in `chars`.

After you are done **modifying the input array**, return _the new length of the array_. 

**Follow up:**  
Could you solve it using only `O(1)` extra space?

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: chars = ["a","a","b","b","c","c","c"]
Output: Return 6, and the first 6 characters of the input array should be: ["a","2","b","2","c","3"]
Explanation: The groups are "aa", "bb", and "ccc". This compresses to "a2b2c3".
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: chars = ["a"]
Output: Return 1, and the first character of the input array should be: ["a"]
Explanation: The only group is "a", which remains uncompressed since it's a single character.
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: chars = ["a","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b"]
Output: Return 4, and the first 4 characters of the input array should be: ["a","b","1","2"].
Explanation: The groups are "a" and "bbbbbbbbbbbb". This compresses to "ab12".
```

**Example 4:**

```text
Input: chars = ["a","a","a","b","b","a","a"]
Output: Return 6, and the first 6 characters of the input array should be: ["a","3","b","2","a","2"].
Explanation: The groups are "aaa", "bb", and "aa". This compresses to "a3b2a2". Note that each group is independent even if two groups have the same character.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= chars.length <= 2000`
* `chars[i]` is a lower-case English letter, upper-case English letter, digit, or symbol.



### 2. Solution

{% hint style="info" %}
**Complexity:**

* Time: O\(n\)  

where n represents the length of array. 

* Space: O\(1\) 

because it edits the char array in-place.
{% endhint %}



### 3. JAVA Implementation

```text
public int compress(char[] chars) {
    if (chars.length <= 1) {
        return chars.length;
    }
    int n = chars.length;
    
    char tmp = ' ';
    boolean append = false;
    if (chars[n - 1] != chars[n - 2]) {
        tmp = chars[n - 1];
        append = true;
    }
    int slow = 0;
    int fast = 1;
    int count = 1;
    while (fast < chars.length) {
        count = 1;
        while (fast < chars.length && chars[fast] == chars[fast - 1]) {
            fast++;
            count++;
        }
            
        chars[slow++] = chars[fast - 1];
        if (count > 1) {
            int digits = 0;
            while (count > 0) {
                int curr = count % 10;
                count /= 10;
                digits++;
                chars[slow++] = Character.forDigit(curr, 10);
            }
            reverse(chars, slow - digits, slow - 1);
        }
        fast++;
    }
        
    if (append) {
        chars[slow++] = tmp;
    }
    
    return slow;
}
    
private void reverse(char[] arr, int left, int right) {
    while (left < right) {
        char c = arr[left];
        arr[left] = arr[right];
        arr[right] = c;
        left++;
        right--;
    }
}
```
