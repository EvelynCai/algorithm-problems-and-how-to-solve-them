# 186. Reverse Words in a String II

### 1. [Description](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-words-in-a-string-ii/)

Given a character array `s`, reverse the order of the **words**.

A **word** is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The **words** in `s` will be separated by a single space.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: s = ["t","h","e"," ","s","k","y"," ","i","s"," ","b","l","u","e"]
Output: ["b","l","u","e"," ","i","s"," ","s","k","y"," ","t","h","e"]
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: s = ["a"]
Output: ["a"]
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= s.length <= 105`
* `s[i]` is an English letter \(uppercase or lowercase\), digit, or space `' '`.
* There is **at least one** word in `s`.
* `s` does not contain leading or trailing spaces.
* All the words in `s` are guaranteed to be separated by a single space.

 **Follow up:** Could you do it **in-place** without allocating extra space?



### 2. Solution

{% hint style="info" %}
**Complexity:**

* Time: O\(n\)  

where n represents the length of array. 

* Space: O\(1\) 

only takes constant extra space

### 3. JAVA Implementation

```text
public void reverseWords(char[] s) {
    reverse(s, 0, s.length - 1);
    int fast = 0;
    int slow = 0;
    while (fast < s.length) {
        while (fast < s.length && s[fast] != ' ') {
            fast++;
        }
        
        reverse(s, slow, fast - 1);
        fast++;
        slow = fast;
    }
}
    
private void reverse(char[] s, int left, int right) {
    while (left < right) {
        char c = s[left];
        s[left] = s[right];
        s[right] = c;
        left++;
        right--;
    }
}
```
