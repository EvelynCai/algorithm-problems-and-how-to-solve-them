# 189. Rotate Array

### 1. [Description](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-array/solution/)

Given an array, rotate the array to the right by _k_ steps, where _k_ is non-negative.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] and k = 3
Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: [-1,-100,3,99] and k = 2
Output: [3,99,-1,-100]
Explanation: 
rotate 1 steps to the right: [99,-1,-100,3]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [3,99,-1,-100]
```

**Note:**

* Try to come up as many solutions as you can, there are at least 3 different ways to solve this problem.
* Could you do it in-place with O\(1\) extra space?



### 2. Solution

To keep the space complexity as constant, the only thing we could use is the input array itself. So what's the result I'm expecting? Take Example 1 for instance.

| index | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| original value | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
| expected value | 5 | 6 | 7 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |

When n = 7 & k = 3, we expect the new start is 5 \(index = 4\) 

So the intuition is to divide the array into 2 parts: 1,2,3,4\| 5,6,7

If we could divide in this way, the rotated result keeps original order within each part, but not inter-part, i.e. 5,6,7 \| 1,2,3,4

Since we have to make it in-place, it's messy to swap elements between these 2 parts. Because part 1 has 4 elements \(1,2,3,4\) while part 2 has 3 elements\(5,6,7\). The spots of each part don't equal, which makes it hard to swap elements between part1 and part2 without extra space.

However, it won't be messy if we just swap the 4 elements in part 1 itself. Nor if we swap within part2 itself. 

So, if we expect 5 to be the new start, why not just reverse the order of "5,6,7" and make 5 to be the tail of the array? 

| index | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| original value | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
| current value | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | **7** | **6** | **5** |

If we look at the array **from right to left**, 5 would be the new start. In this way, we have 5, 6, 7, \| 4, 3, 2, 1 now.

What are we expecting overall? 5,6,7\| 1,2,3,4

It make sense to reverse the order of part1 itself

| index | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| original value | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
| current value | **4** | **3** | **2** | **1** | 7 | 6 | 5 |

Now, from right to left, we have 5,6,7 \| 1,2,3,4

How could we get the same order from left to right? Just reverse the whole array.

| index | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| original value | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
| current value | **5** | **6** | **7** | **1** | **2** | **3** | **4** |

Viola!

**Complexity:**

{% hint style="info" %}
* Time: O\(n\)  

where n represents the length of input array. 

* Space: O\(1\) 

as required.
{% endhint %}



### 3. JAVA Implementation

```text
public void rotate(int[] nums, int k) {
  if (nums == null || nums.length == 0) {
    return;
  }
  
  k %= nums.length;
  reverse(nums, nums.length - k, nums.length - 1);
  reverse(nums, 0, (nums.length - k) - 1);
  reverse(nums, 0, nums.length - 1);
}
 
private void reverse(int[] nums, int start, int end) {
  while (start < end) {
    int tmp = nums[start];
    nums[start] = nums[end];
    nums[end] = tmp;
    start++;
    end--;
  }
}
```
