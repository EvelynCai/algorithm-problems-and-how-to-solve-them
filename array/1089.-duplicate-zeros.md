# 1089. Duplicate Zeros

### 1. [Description](https://leetcode.com/problems/duplicate-zeros/description/)

Given a fixed length array `arr` of integers, duplicate each occurrence of zero, shifting the remaining elements to the right.

Note that elements beyond the length of the original array are not written.

Do the above modifications to the input array **in place**, do not return anything from your function.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: [1,0,2,3,0,4,5,0]
Output: null
Explanation: After calling your function, the input array is modified to: [1,0,0,2,3,0,0,4]
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: [1,2,3]
Output: null
Explanation: After calling your function, the input array is modified to: [1,2,3]
```

**Note:**

1. `1 <= arr.length <= 10000`
2. `0 <= arr[i] <= 9`



### 2. Solution

Everytime we need to insert an additional 0 after any given 0, we should shift all the elements on its right. So the worst case could take O\(n ^ 2\) time when we have to shift for each and every element. 

The time complexity could be optimized to O\(n\) if we scan and operate from the end instead of start so that we shift once rather than nth. The problem follows up is how many spots from the end should I spare for the additional 0s? 

If we count the amount of given 0s, we could get the answer.

Solution 1: 2 passes over input + 2 pointers

* in 1st pass: count how many 0s are given, `zeroAmount`
* initialize a pointer `read` which represents the position whose value we are reading, starting from `input.length - 1`
* initialize a pointer `write` which represents the potential position whose value we are writing, starting from `input.length - 1 + zeroAmount.`Potential because when it's out of array bound if &gt;= input.length
* in 2nd pass: while `write >= 0 && read >= 0`:
  * if `input[read] != 0` , copy to `write` if in-bound \(`write < input.length`\) -&gt; input\[write\] = input\[read\]
  * otherwise, copy 0 twice to `write` and `write - 1` if in-bound -&gt; `input[write--] = 0; input[write] = input[read]` 
  * read-- & write--

**Complexity:**

{% hint style="info" %}
* Time: O\(n\)  

where n represents the length of array. It requires 2 pass over in the array takes O\(n\) when copy a single element takes constant O\(1\).

* Space: O\(1\) 

only takes constant extra space for index in iteration etc.
{% endhint %}

Solution 2.  Queue

Use a queue as buffer to keep the order of un-copied elements due to the additional 0s.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Complexity:**

* Time: O\(n\)  

where n represents the length of array.

* space: O\(n\)

takes extra space for queue, which could contain all the elements in the worst case.
{% endhint %}



### 3. JAVA Implementation

Solution 1: copy

```text
public void duplicateZeros(int[] arr) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int num: arr) {
        if (num == 0) {
            count++;
        }
    }
        
    int read = arr.length - 1;
    int write = arr.length - 1 + count;
    while (read >= 0 && write >= 0) {
        if (arr[read] != 0) {
            if (write < arr.length) {
                arr[write] = arr[read];
            }
        } else {
            if (write < arr.length) {
                arr[write] = 0;
            }
                
            write--;
            
            if (write < arr.length) {
                arr[write] = 0;
            }
        }
            
        read--;
        write--;
    }
}
```

Solution 2: 

```text
public void duplicateZeros(int[] arr) {        
    Queue<Integer> q = new LinkedList<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        if (arr[i] == 0) {
            q.offer(0);
        }
        q.offer(arr[i]);
            
        if (!q.isEmpty()) {
            arr[i] = q.poll();
        }
    }
}
```

### 4. Analysis

* examining the basic features & operations of arrays
  * feature: fixed length & have to shift all elements on the right if insert in a certain spot \(not tail\)
  * operation: copy
