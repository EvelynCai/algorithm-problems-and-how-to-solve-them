# 376. Wiggle Subsequence

### 1.[ Description](https://leetcode.com/problems/wiggle-subsequence/description/)

A sequence of numbers is called a **wiggle sequence** if the differences between successive numbers strictly alternate between positive and negative. The first difference \(if one exists\) may be either positive or negative. A sequence with fewer than two elements is trivially a wiggle sequence.

For example, `[1,7,4,9,2,5]` is a wiggle sequence because the differences `(6,-3,5,-7,3)` are alternately positive and negative. In contrast, `[1,4,7,2,5]` and `[1,7,4,5,5]` are not wiggle sequences, the first because its first two differences are positive and the second because its last difference is zero.

Given a sequence of integers, return the length of the longest subsequence that is a wiggle sequence. A subsequence is obtained by deleting some number of elements \(eventually, also zero\) from the original sequence, leaving the remaining elements in their original order.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: [1,7,4,9,2,5]
Output: 6
Explanation: The entire sequence is a wiggle sequence.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: [1,17,5,10,13,15,10,5,16,8]
Output: 7
Explanation: There are several subsequences that achieve this length. One is [1,17,10,13,10,16,8].
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
Output: 2
```

Can you do it in O\(n\) time?  


### 2. Solution

To solve the problem in O\(n\) time, the solution would involve iteration of the array. So in the iteration, if we compare nums\[i\] with its previous element, there could be 3 results:

* `nums[i] > nums[i - 1`\]: for the longest wiggle ending with current element, it's an ascending sequence.
* `nums[i] < nums[i - 1]`: for the longest wiggle ending with current element, it's an descending sequence.
* `nums[i] = nums[i - 1]`: the current element doesn't form a longer wiggle sequence than its previous element.

If we record length of the longest wiggle sequence ending with its previous element, than we can get that of current element by adding 1. Since there are 2 alternatives to update \(ascending / descending\), we need 2 variables to record: `up` and `down` :

* `nums[i] > nums[i - 1`\]: -&gt; extending as ascending ending-&gt; update  `up = down + 1`
* `nums[i] < nums[i - 1]`: -&gt; extending as descending ending-&gt; update `down = up + 1`

After the iteration, `up` and `down` refer to the longest wiggle ascending / descending sequences ended with the last element. 

So the result would be the max within these two variables.

**Complexity:**

{% hint style="info" %}
* Time: O\(n\)  

where n refers to the length of input array. In essence, we are iterating the input array. For each of the n elements, comparing and updating records of up/down takes O\(1\) time.

* Space: O\(1\)

### 3. JAVA Implementation

```text
public int wiggleMaxLength(int[] nums) {
    if (nums == null || nums.length == 0) {
        return 0;
    }
        
    int up = 1;
    int down = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
        if (nums[i] > nums[i - 1]) {
            up = down + 1;
        } else if (nums[i] < nums[i - 1]) {
            down = up + 1;
        }
    }
        
    return Math.max(up, down);
}
```
