# 75. Sort Colors

### 1. [Description](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-colors/description/)

Given an array with _n_ objects colored red, white or blue, sort them [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) ****so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white and blue.

Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively.

**Note:** You are not suppose to use the library's sort function for this problem.

**Example:**

```text
Input: [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
```

**Follow up:**

* A rather straight forward solution is a two-pass algorithm using counting sort. First, iterate the array counting number of 0's, 1's, and 2's, then overwrite array with total number of 0's, then 1's and followed by 2's.
* Could you come up with a one-pass algorithm using only constant space?



### 2. Solution

To solve the problem in one-pass, we need to iterate the array. When looking at each element, we want to determine if it is at the correct position:

* if so, continue iteration
* if not, swap it to the proper place and go on

Therefore, we need 3 pointers:

* `p1`: all elements before it should be 0 \(exclusively\), starting from 0 to len
* `p2`: all elements after it should be 2 \(exclusively\), starting from len - 1 to 0
* `i` : all elements before it \(AND after p1\) should be 1 \(exclusively\), starting from p1 to p2

So the array will be divided by the 3 pointers as:

00000 &lt;p1&gt;  11111 &lt;i&gt;  ???????  &lt;p2&gt; 22222

During the iteration:

* if `nums[i] == 0` , the current element should be before p1 =&gt; swap it with nums\[p1\] =&gt; i points to a 1 \(swapped by p1\), so we increase i by 1 AND p1 points to a 0 \(swapped by i\), but p1's left are 0s\(exclusively\), so we increase p1 by1 too.
* if `nums[i] == 1` , the current element should be here =&gt; continue iteration to check the next element =&gt; increase i by 1
* if `nums[i] == 2` , the current element should be after p2 =&gt; swap it with nums\[p2\] =&gt; i points to an unknown num swapped by p2, so do nothing with i now & p2 points to a 2\(swapped by i\), but p2's right are 2s \(exclusively\), so we decrease p2 by 1

**Complexity:**

{% hint style="info" %}
* Time: O\(n\)  

where n represents the length of input array. In essence, we are iterate to array and the comparison and swap for each element takes O\(1\) time.

* Space: O\(1\) 
{% endhint %}



### 3. JAVA Implementation

```text
public void sortColors(int[] nums) {
    // edge cases
    if (nums == null || nums.length == 0) {
        return;
    }
        
    int p1 = 0;
    int p2 = nums.length - 1;
    int i = 0;
    while (i <= p2) {
        if (nums[i] == 0) {
            swap(nums, i, p1);
            i++;
            p1++;
        } else if (nums[i] == 1) {
            i++;
        } else {
            swap(nums, i, p2);
            p2--;
        }
    }
}
    
private void swap(int[] nums, int a, int b) {
    int tmp = nums[a];
    nums[a] = nums[b];
    nums[b] = tmp;
}
```
