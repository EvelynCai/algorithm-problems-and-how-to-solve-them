# 969. Pancake Sorting

### 1. [Description](https://leetcode.com/problems/pancake-sorting/)

Given an array of integers `arr`, sort the array by performing a series of **pancake flips**.

In one pancake flip we do the following steps:

* Choose an integer `k` where `1 <= k <= arr.length`.
* Reverse the sub-array `arr[1...k]`.

For example, if `arr = [3,2,1,4]` and we performed a pancake flip choosing `k = 3`, we reverse the sub-array `[3,2,1]`, so `arr = [`**`1,2,3,4`**`]` after the pancake flip at `k = 3`.

Return _the `k`-values corresponding to a sequence of pancake flips that sort `arr`_. Any valid answer that sorts the array within `10 * arr.length` flips will be judged as correct.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: arr = [3,2,4,1]
Output: [4,2,4,3]
Explanation: 
We perform 4 pancake flips, with k values 4, 2, 4, and 3.
Starting state: arr = [3, 2, 4, 1]
After 1st flip (k = 4): arr = [1, 4, 2, 3]
After 2nd flip (k = 2): arr = [4, 1, 2, 3]
After 3rd flip (k = 4): arr = [3, 2, 1, 4]
After 4th flip (k = 3): arr = [1, 2, 3, 4], which is sorted.
Notice that we return an array of the chosen k values of the pancake flips.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: arr = [1,2,3]
Output: []
Explanation: The input is already sorted, so there is no need to flip anything.
Note that other answers, such as [3, 3], would also be accepted.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= arr.length <= 100`
* `1 <= arr[i] <= arr.length`
* All integers in `arr` are unique \(i.e. `arr` is a permutation of the integers from `1` to `arr.length`\).



### 2. Solution

Like bubble sort, pancake sortï¼š

1. picks the largest unsorted element each round
2. puts the largest unsorted element at the end of the unsorted part
3. adjust the delimiter between unsorted and sorted part

The key difference is how to put the largest unsorted element to the end of unsorted part.

In pancake sort, we use "pancake flips" which:

* flips the k-th element from its current position\(x\) to index = 0
* flips the k-th element from 0 to index = k

**Complexity:**

{% hint style="info" %}
* Time: O\(n ^ 2\)  

where n represents the length of input array. It takes O\(n\) to pancake flip one element to its proper position. In total, there are n elements to be pancake flipped.

* Space: O\(1\) 

because there's no extra space used.
{% endhint %}



### 3. JAVA Implementation

```text
public List<Integer> pancakeSort(int[] A) {
    List<Integer> res = new ArrayList<>();
    
    for (int largest = A.length; largest >= 1; i--) {
        int index = findIndex(A, largest);
        flip(A, index); // index = [0, n - 1]
        res.add(index + 1); // record value = [1, n] 
                
        flip(A, largest - 1);
        res.add(largest);
    }
    
    return res;
}

private void flip(int[] A, int end) {
    int start = 0;
    while (start < end) {
        int tmp = A[start];
        A[start] = A[end];
        A[end] = tmp;
        start++;
        end--;
    }
}

private int findIndex(int[] A, int target) {
    for (int i = 0; i < A.length; i++) {
        if (A[i] == target) {
            return i;
        }
    }
    
    return -1;
}
```

### 4. Comments

* The values to be recorded in list should be \[1, n\], while the index should be \[0, n - 1\]. So the parameters to be flipped vs. recorded are different.
