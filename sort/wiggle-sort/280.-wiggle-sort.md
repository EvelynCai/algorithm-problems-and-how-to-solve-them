# 280. Wiggle Sort

### 1. [Description](https://leetcode.com/problems/wiggle-sort/description/)

Given an unsorted array `nums`, reorder it **in-place** such that `nums[0] <= nums[1] >= nums[2] <= nums[3]...`.

**Example:**

```text
Input: nums = [3,5,2,1,6,4]
Output: One possible answer is [3,5,1,6,2,4]
```



### 2. Solution

To solve the problem in-place, my intuition is to swap. If swapping an "invalid" element with its next one could make the flow "valid" again, then we could take it as a walkaround.

| index | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| original val | 3 | 5 | 2 | 1 | 6 | 4 |
| compare to find invalid | 3 | 5 | ~~2~~ | ~~1~~ |  |  |
| swapped val to make it valid | 3 | 5 | 1 | 2 |  |  |
| compare \(cont.\) to find invalid | 3 | 5 | 1 | ~~2~~ | ~~6~~ |  |
| swapped val to make it valid | 3 | 5 | 1 | 6 | 2 |  |
| compare \(cont.\) to find invalid | 3 | 5 | 1 | 6 | 2 | 4 |

After the iteration, all "invalid" elements should be swapped with its next, so that all elements in the array should be "valid" now.

How to define the "invalid" elements:

* compare `nums[i]` with `nums[i + 1]`:
  * if we are expecting `nums[i] <= nums[i + 1]`, then `nums[i]` is "invalid" if `nums[i] > nums[i + 1]` -&gt; swap nums\[i\] with nums\[i + 1\] -&gt; increase i by 1 because we consider the swap makes nums\[i\] satisfy the condition for now.
  * if we are expecting `nums[i] >= nums[i + 1]`, then `nums[i]` is "invalid" if `nums[i] < nums[i + 1]` -&gt; swap nums\[i\] with nums\[i + 1\] -&gt; increase i by 1 because we consider the swap makes nums\[i\] satisfy the condition for now.
  * otherwise, just increase i by 1
* always alter the "expectation" between "&lt;=" and "&gt;=" after visiting each element

**Complexity:**

{% hint style="info" %}
* Time: O\(n\)  

where n represents the length of input array. In essence, we are iterate to array and the comparison and swap for each element takes O\(1\) time.

* Space: O\(1\) 
{% endhint %}



### 3. JAVA Implementation

```text
public void wiggleSort(int[] nums) {
    if (nums == null || nums.length == 0) {
        return;
    }
        
    boolean ascend = true;
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length - 1; i++) {
        if (ascend && nums[i] > nums[i + 1] || !ascend && nums[i] < nums[i + 1]) {
            swap(nums, i, i + 1);
        }
        
        ascend = !ascend;
    }
}
    
private void swap(int[] nums, int a, int b) {
    int tmp = nums[a];
    nums[a] = nums[b];
    nums[b] = tmp;
}
```
