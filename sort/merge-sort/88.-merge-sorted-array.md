# 88. Merge Sorted Array

### 1. [Description](https://leetcode.com/problems/duplicate-zeros/description/)

Given two sorted integer arrays _nums1_ and _nums2_, merge _nums2_ into _nums1_ as one sorted array.

**Assumption:**

* The number of elements initialized in _nums1_ and _nums2_ are _m_ and _n_ respectively.
* You may assume that _nums1_ has enough space \(size that is greater or equal to _m_ + _n_\) to hold additional elements from _nums2_.

**Example:**

```text
Input:
nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3
nums2 = [2,5,6],       n = 3

Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
```



### 2. Solution

Since we assume that 

* _nums1_ has enough space to hold additional elements from _nums2_.

We can overwrite nums1 with index `i` from `nums1.length - 1` to `0`:

* while m, n are valid \(in case of array out of bound\)
  * compare nums1\[m - 1\] vs nums2\[n - 1\]
  * copy the larger value to nums1\[i\] 
  * decrease `i` and `m/n` which points to the larger value
* copy the remaining nums2 elements to nums1 if`n > 0`

**Complexity:**

{% hint style="info" %}
* Time: O\(m + n\)  

where m represents valid numbers in nums1 and n represents that of nums2. In essence, we need to iterate both array and do comparisons\(takes O\(1\) each time\) along the process.

* Space: O\(1\) 

only takes constant extra space for pointers etc.

### 3. JAVA Implementation

```text
public void merge(int[] nums1, int m, int[] nums2, int n) {
    int index = nums1.length - 1;
    while (m > 0 && n > 0){
        if (nums1[m - 1] > nums2[n - 1]) {
            nums1[index--] = nums1[--m];
        } else {
            nums1[index--] = nums2[--n];
        }
    }
        
    while (n > 0) {
        nums1[index--] = nums2[--n];
    }
}
```



### 4. Comments

* examining the basic features & operations of arrays & merge method in mergeSort
  * feature: fixed length
  * operation: copy
  * merge method in mergeSort\(ascending\):
    * compare elements from two arrays 
    * pick the smaller one & update its index to index + 1
    * update mergedIndex to mergedIndex + 1
