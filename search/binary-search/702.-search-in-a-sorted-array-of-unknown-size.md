# 702. Search in a Sorted Array of Unknown Size

### 1. [Description](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-a-sorted-array-of-unknown-size/)

Given an integer array sorted in ascending order, write a function to search `target` in `nums`.  If `target` exists, then return its index, otherwise return `-1`. **However, the array size is unknown to you**. You may only access the array using an `ArrayReader` interface, where `ArrayReader.get(k)` returns the element of the array at index `k` \(0-indexed\).

You may assume all integers in the array are less than `10000`, and if you access the array out of bounds, `ArrayReader.get` will return `2147483647`.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: array = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9
Output: 4
Explanation: 9 exists in nums and its index is 4
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: array = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 2
Output: -1
Explanation: 2 does not exist in nums so return -1
```

**Constraints:**

* You may assume that all elements in the array are unique.
* The value of each element in the array will be in the range `[-9999, 9999]`.
* The length of the array will be in the range `[1, 10^4]`.

### 2. Solution

To search a target in an unknown-size sorted array, we could make it by:

* doubling the index until we find the right search boundary, i.e. `reader.get(index) >= target`
* binary search in \[0, index\]

{% hint style="info" %}
Complexity:

* Time: O\(logn\)

where n represents the index of target \(or the index of a closest value to target\). 

To find the right search boundary, we double the index k times until reader.get\(n\)&gt;= target, so 2 ^ k = n, i.e. k = logn

To run binary search on \[0,n\], the complexity takes O\(logn\) as well.

So the overall \(dominant\) time complexity is O\(logn\)

* Space: O\(1\)

because it takes constant auxiliary space to find right boundary and do binary search.
{% endhint %}



### 3. JAVA Solution

```text
/**
 * // This is ArrayReader's API interface.
 * // You should not implement it, or speculate about its implementation
 * interface ArrayReader {
 *     public int get(int index) {}
 * }
 */

public int search(ArrayReader reader, int target) {
    int right = guessMax(reader, target);
    int left = right / 2;
    while (left + 1 < right) {
        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
        int midVal = reader.get(mid);
        if (midVal == target) {
            return mid;
        } else if (midVal < target) {
            left = mid;
        } else {
            right = mid;
        }
    }
        
    if (reader.get(left) == target) {
        return left;
    } else if (reader.get(right) == target) {
        return right;
    } else {
        return -1;
    }
}

private int guessMax(ArrayReader reader, int target) {
    int res = 1;
    while (reader.get(res) < target) {
        res *= 2;
    }
    return res;
}
```

### 4. Comments

* The termination condition of binary search here is `while (left + 1 == right)`
  * **because** `target` may not exist, so we stops at the closest 2 "suspects"
  * **then** we always check the 2 "suspects" separately:
    * if either one is equal, target found and return it
    * if none = target, return -1;
