# 547. Number of Provinces

### 1.[ Description](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-provinces/)

There are `n` cities. Some of them are connected, while some are not. If city `a` is connected directly with city `b`, and city `b` is connected directly with city `c`, then city `a` is connected indirectly with city `c`.

A **province** is a group of directly or indirectly connected cities and no other cities outside of the group.

You are given an `n x n` matrix `isConnected` where `isConnected[i][j] = 1` if the `ith` city and the `jth` city are directly connected, and `isConnected[i][j] = 0` otherwise.

Return _the total number of **provinces**_.

**Example 1:**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/24/graph1.jpg)

```text
Input: isConnected = [[1,1,0],[1,1,0],[0,0,1]]
Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/24/graph2.jpg)

```text
Input: isConnected = [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1]]
Output: 3
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= n <= 200`
* `n == isConnected.length`
* `n == isConnected[i].length`
* `isConnected[i][j]` is `1` or `0`.
* `isConnected[i][i] == 1`
* `isConnected[i][j] == isConnected[j][i]`

### 3. JAVA Implementation

```text
public int findCircleNum(int[][] M) {
    if (M == null || M.length == 0 || M[0] == null || M[0].length == 0) {
        return 0;
    }

    int m = M.length;
    int count = 0;
    int[] visited = new int[m];
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        if (visited[i] == 0) {
            count++;
            dfs(M, visited, i);
        }
    }

    return count;
}

private void dfs(int[][] M, int[] visited, int i) {
    for (int j = 0; j < visited.length; j++) {
        if (visited[j] == 0 && M[i][j] == 1) {
            visited[j] = 1;
            dfs(M, visited, j);
        }
    }
}
```
