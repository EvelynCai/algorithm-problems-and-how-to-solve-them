# 794. Valid Tic-Tac-Toe State

### 1. [Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-tic-tac-toe-state/description/)

A Tic-Tac-Toe board is given as a string array `board`. Return True if and only if it is possible to reach this board position during the course of a valid tic-tac-toe game.

The `board` is a 3 x 3 array, and consists of characters `" "`, `"X"`, and `"O"`.  The " " character represents an empty square.

Here are the rules of Tic-Tac-Toe:

* Players take turns placing characters into empty squares \(" "\).
* The first player always places "X" characters, while the second player always places "O" characters.
* "X" and "O" characters are always placed into empty squares, never filled ones.
* The game ends when there are 3 of the same \(non-empty\) character filling any row, column, or diagonal.
* The game also ends if all squares are non-empty.
* No more moves can be played if the game is over.

```text
Example 1:
Input: board = ["O  ", "   ", "   "]
Output: false
Explanation: The first player always plays "X".

Example 2:
Input: board = ["XOX", " X ", "   "]
Output: false
Explanation: Players take turns making moves.

Example 3:
Input: board = ["XXX", "   ", "OOO"]
Output: false

Example 4:
Input: board = ["XOX", "O O", "XOX"]
Output: true
```

**Note:**

* `board` is a length-3 array of strings, where each string `board[i]` has length 3.
* Each `board[i][j]` is a character in the set `{" ", "X", "O"}`.



### **2. Analysis:** 

 We could define a valid state by the given conditions:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align:left">Given condition</th>
      <th style="text-align:left">Inference</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left">
        <p></p>
        <p>Players take turns placing characters into empty squares (&quot; &quot;)</p>
      </td>
      <td style="text-align:left">
        <p></p>
        <p>If it&apos;s valid, the difference between player 1 and player 2 must
          be 1 or 0</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left">
        <p></p>
        <p>The first player always places &quot;X&quot; characters, while the second
          player always places &quot;O&quot; characters</p>
      </td>
      <td style="text-align:left">If it&apos;s valid, the difference between &quot;X&quot; amount and &quot;O&quot;
        amount must be 1 or 0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left">
        <p></p>
        <p>&quot;X&quot; and &quot;O&quot; characters are always placed into empty
          squares, never filled ones</p>
      </td>
      <td style="text-align:left"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left">
        <p></p>
        <p>The game ends when there are 3 of the same (non-empty) character filling
          any row, column, or diagonal</p>
      </td>
      <td style="text-align:left">
        <p>If it&apos;s valid and there are 3 same marks in a row/column/diagonal,
          <br
          />*player 1 will win if the mark is &apos;X&apos; and difference of marks
          is 0;</p>
        <p>*player 2 will win if the mark is &apos;O&apos; and difference of marks
          is 1</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left">
        <p></p>
        <p>The game also ends if all squares are non-empty</p>
      </td>
      <td style="text-align:left"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left">
        <p></p>
        <p>No more moves can be played if the game is over</p>
      </td>
      <td style="text-align:left"></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

**Complexity:**

{% hint style="info" %}
Time: O\(1\)

because the size of the board is a fixed 3 \* 3 and we just need to iterate and count the amount of 'X' and 'O' for calculation

Space: O\(1\)

because we are only taking constant extra space to store the count of 'X' and 'O' and their difference.
{% endhint %}



### 3. JAVA Implementation:

```text
public boolean validTicTacToe(String[] board) {
    int xCount = 0;
    int oCount = 0;
    for (String s: board) {
        for (char c: s.toCharArray()) {
            if (c == 'O') {
                oCount++;
            } else if (c == 'X') {
                xCount++;
            }
        }
    }
    
    int diff = xCount - oCount;
    if (diff < 0 || diff > 1) {
        return false;
    }
    
    if (diff == 0 && win(board, 'X')) {
        return false;
    }
    
    if (diff == 1 && win(board, 'O')) {
        return false;
    }

    return true;
}

private boolean win(String[] board, char mark) {
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
        if (board[i].charAt(0) == mark && board[i].charAt(1) == mark && board[i].charAt(2) == mark) {
            return true;
        }
        if (board[0].charAt(i) == mark && board[1].charAt(i) == mark && board[2].charAt(i) == mark) {
            return true;
        }        
    }
    
    if (board[0].charAt(0) == mark && board[1].charAt(1) == mark && board[2].charAt(2) == mark) {
        return true;
    }
    
    if (board[0].charAt(2) == mark && board[1].charAt(1) == mark && board[2].charAt(0) == mark) {
        return true;
    }   
    
     return false; 
}
```



### 4. Comments

* The key of this problem is more of interpreting the conditions and model them.
