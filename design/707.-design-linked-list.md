# 707. Design Linked List

### 1. [Description](https://leetcode.com/problems/design-linked-list/)

Design your implementation of the linked list. You can choose to use the singly linked list or the doubly linked list. A node in a singly linked list should have two attributes: `val` and `next`. `val` is the value of the current node, and `next` is a pointer/reference to the next node. If you want to use the doubly linked list, you will need one more attribute `prev` to indicate the previous node in the linked list. Assume all nodes in the linked list are 0-indexed.

Implement these functions in your linked list class:

* get\(index\) : Get the value of the `index`-th node in the linked list. If the index is invalid, return `-1`.
* addAtHead\(val\) : Add a node of value `val` before the first element of the linked list. After the insertion, the new node will be the first node of the linked list.
* addAtTail\(val\) : Append a node of value `val` to the last element of the linked list.
* addAtIndex\(index, val\) : Add a node of value `val` before the `index`-th node in the linked list. If `index` equals to the length of linked list, the node will be appended to the end of linked list. If index is greater than the length, the node will not be inserted. If index is negative, the node will be inserted at the head of the list.
* deleteAtIndex\(index\) : Delete the `index`-th node in the linked list, if the index is valid.

**Example:**

```text
MyLinkedList linkedList = new MyLinkedList();
linkedList.addAtHead(1);
linkedList.addAtTail(3);
linkedList.addAtIndex(1, 2);  // linked list becomes 1->2->3
linkedList.get(1);            // returns 2
linkedList.deleteAtIndex(1);  // now the linked list is 1->3
linkedList.get(1);            // returns 3
```

**Note:**

* All values will be in the range of `[1, 1000]`.
* The number of operations will be in the range of `[1, 1000]`.
* Please do not use the built-in LinkedList library.



### 2. Solution

If we want to design a singly linked list and have a closer look at the APIs, there are 3 methods for adding new nodes to this linked list:

* head
* tail
* given index

Since the index is based on 0, generally speaking, we could treat `head` as 0, `tail`as size. So the problem is abstracted into 2 parts:

* add a node at given index
* delete a node at given index

So how could we tell the validity of an index in O\(1\) time? We need to keep track of a `size`, otherwise we have to iterate the list in O\(n\) time to get the current size.

Apart from the `size` attribute, we also need a Node to keep track of the list.

Since a list could be empty until user add nodes, it doesn't make sense to track the first node of the list. Instead, we need to track the node before first node:

* before list initialization: Node prev = null;
* when list is initialized but not added: Node prev = new Node\(0\);
* when the list has been added some nodes: return prev.next as the head of list

{% hint style="info" %}
* Time: 
  * add: O\(n\) where n represents the size of list. Because adding to a given position at the worst case could requires an entire iteration.
  * delete: O\(n\), similar to add.
* Space: O\(1\)  
{% endhint %}



### 3. JAVA Implementation

```text
class MyLinkedList {

    class Node{
        int val;
        Node next;
        Node(int val) {
            this.val = val;
        }
    }
    
    Node dummy;
    int size;
    
    /** Initialize your data structure here. */
    public MyLinkedList() {
        dummy = new Node(-1);
        size = 0;
    }
    
    /** Get the value of the index-th node in the linked list. If the index is invalid, return -1. */
    public int get(int index) {
        if (index < 0 || index >= size) {
            return -1;
        }
        
        Node curr = dummy;
        for (int i = 0; i <= index; i++) {
            curr = curr.next;
        }
        
        return curr.val;
    }
    
    /** Add a node of value val before the first element of the linked list. After the insertion, the new node will be the first node of the linked list. */
    public void addAtHead(int val) {
        addAtIndex(0, val);
    }
    
    /** Append a node of value val to the last element of the linked list. */
    public void addAtTail(int val) {
        addAtIndex(size, val);
    }
    
    /** Add a node of value val before the index-th node in the linked list. If index equals to the length of linked list, the node will be appended to the end of linked list. If index is greater than the length, the node will not be inserted. */
    public void addAtIndex(int index, int val) {
        if (index > size) {
            return;
        } else if (index < 0) {
            index = 0;
        }
        size++;
        
        Node prev = dummy;
        for (int i = 0; i < index; i++) {
            prev = prev.next;
        }
        
        Node tmpNext = prev.next;
        Node newNode = new Node(val);
        prev.next = newNode;
        newNode.next = tmpNext;
    }
    
    /** Delete the index-th node in the linked list, if the index is valid. */
    public void deleteAtIndex(int index) {
        if (index < 0 || index >= size) {
            return;
        }
        size--;
        
        Node prev = dummy;
        for (int i = 0; i < index; i++) {
            prev = prev.next;
        }
        
        prev.next = prev.next.next;
    }
}

/**
 * Your MyLinkedList object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * MyLinkedList obj = new MyLinkedList();
 * int param_1 = obj.get(index);
 * obj.addAtHead(val);
 * obj.addAtTail(val);
 * obj.addAtIndex(index,val);
 * obj.deleteAtIndex(index);
