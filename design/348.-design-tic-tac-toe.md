# 348. Design Tic-Tac-Toe

### 1. [Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/design-tic-tac-toe/description/)

Design a Tic-tac-toe game that is played between two players on a n x n grid.

You may assume the following rules:

1. A move is guaranteed to be valid and is placed on an empty block.
2. Once a winning condition is reached, no more moves is allowed.
3. A player who succeeds in placing n of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

**Example:**

```text
Given n = 3, assume that player 1 is "X" and player 2 is "O" in the board.

TicTacToe toe = new TicTacToe(3);

toe.move(0, 0, 1); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
|X| | |
| | | |    // Player 1 makes a move at (0, 0).
| | | |

toe.move(0, 2, 2); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
| | | |    // Player 2 makes a move at (0, 2).
| | | |

toe.move(2, 2, 1); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
| | | |    // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 2).
| | |X|

toe.move(1, 1, 2); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
| |O| |    // Player 2 makes a move at (1, 1).
| | |X|

toe.move(2, 0, 1); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
| |O| |    // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 0).
|X| |X|

toe.move(1, 0, 2); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
|O|O| |    // Player 2 makes a move at (1, 0).
|X| |X|

toe.move(2, 1, 1); -> Returns 1 (player 1 wins)
|X| |O|
|O|O| |    // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 1).
|X|X|X|
```

Could you do better than O\(n^2\) per `move()` operation?  


### **2. Analysis:** 

If a move\(\) results in a winning of the game, the winner must be the player passed from parameter. Otherwise the game should have ended before current move. So we only care about if the current move\(\) makes the current player win.

So how to determine a win? We need to figure out how to represent and differentiate the 2 marks and/or players. Suppose we use int to represent the "mark": 

* use 1 to mark player 1's move
* user -1 to mark player 2's move 
* if the sum of any row/column/diagonal = n, player 1 wins
* if the sum of any row/column/diagonal = -n, player 2 wins

However, as requested, if we want the move\(\) operation better than O\(n^2\), we cannot simply iterate the matrix to add up each row/col/diagonal. What if we keep a record of the sum of each row/column/diagonal per move?

So the problem follows up: how to store the state\(marks\) of each row/col/diagonal? We could initiate:

* int\[n\] rows
* int\[n\] cols
* int diagonal
* int antiDiagonal

As long as we update and check the rows/cols/diagonal/antiDiagonal after each move, we could get the result in O\(n\) time complexity.

**Complexity:**

{% hint style="info" %}
Time: O\(n\)

where n represents the border length of the matrix.

Space: O\(n\)

because we need extra int\[n\] to store rows and cols.
{% endhint %}



### 3. JAVA Implementation:

```text
class TicTacToe {
    private int[] rows;
    private int[] cols;
    private int diagonal;
    private int antiDiagonal;
    
    public TicTacToe(int n) {
        rows = new int[n];
        cols = new int[n];
    }
    
    public int move(int row, int col, int player) {
        int mark = player == 1? 1 : -1;
        int n = rows.length;
        
        rows[row] += mark;
        cols[col] += mark;
        if (row == col) {
            diagonal += mark;
        }
        
        if (row == n - col - 1) {
            antiDiagonal += mark;
        }
        
        if (Math.abs(rows[row]) == n || Math.abs(cols[col]) == n || Math.abs(diagonal) == n || Math.abs(antiDiagonal) == n) {
            return player;
        }
        
        return 0;
    }
}
```

* For points on diagonal: row = col
* For points on antiDiagonal: row + col = len - 1
