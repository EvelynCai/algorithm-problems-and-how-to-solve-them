# 144. Binary Tree Preorder Traversal

### 1.[ Description](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-preorder-traversal/description/)

Given a binary tree, return the _preorder_ traversal of its nodes' values.

**Example:**

```text
Input: [1,null,2,3]
   1
    \
     2
    /
   3

Output: [1,2,3]
```

**Follow up:** Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?



### 2. Solution

Preorder traversal means we traverse all the nodes in this tree with the order: root -&gt; leftChild -&gt; rightChild

**2.1 Recursion**

When looking at each node in this tree, determine: 

* if root is null -&gt; nothing to do -&gt; return;
* otherwise:
  * add the value of root in result list
  * recursive call to its leftChild 
  * recursive call to its rightChild

{% hint style="info" %}
* Time: O\(n\)  

where n represents the amount of nodes in tree. After all, traversal means visit all the nodes in the tree.

* Space: O\(n\)  

where n represents the amount of nodes in tree. In the worst case, the recursion call stack has to store all the nodes if it's skewed as a linked list.
{% endhint %}

**2.2 Iteration**

Based on recursion solution, we could solve it iteratively by maintaining our explicit "call stack":

* If root is null -&gt; return empty list
* otherwise, push it to stack
* While the stack is not empty:
  * pop the top of stack as root
  * add root.val in the result list
  * if rightChild is not null -&gt; push to stack \(because stack is LIFO\)
  * if leftChild is not null -&gt; push to stack

{% hint style="info" %}
**Complexity:**

* Time: O\(n\)  

  where n represents the amount of nodes in tree. After all, traversal means visit all the nodes in the tree.

* Space: O\(n\)  

  where n represents the amount of nodes in tree. In the worst case, the stack has to store all the nodes if it's skewed as a linked list.

### 3. JAVA Implementation

```text
public class TreeNode {
     int val;
     TreeNode left;
     TreeNode right;
     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
}

public List<Integer> preorderTraversal(TreeNode root) {
        List<Integer> res = new ArrayList<>();
        if (root == null) {
            return res;
        }
        
        Stack<TreeNode> stack = new Stack<>();
        stack.push(root);
        
        while (!stack.isEmpty()) {
            root = stack.pop();
            res.add(root.val);
            
            // push right first because stack is LIFO
            if (root.right != null) {
                stack.push(root.right);
            }
            
            if (root.left != null) {
                stack.push(root.left);
            }
        }
        
        return res;
}
```
