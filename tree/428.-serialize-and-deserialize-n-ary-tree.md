# 428. Serialize and Deserialize N-ary Tree

### 1. [Description](https://leetcode.com/problems/serialize-and-deserialize-n-ary-tree/description/)

Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize an N-ary tree. An N-ary tree is a rooted tree in which each node has no more than N children. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that an N-ary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

For example, you may serialize the following `3-ary` tree

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/12/narytreeexample.png)

as `[1 [3[5 6] 2 4]]`. You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.

**Note:**

1. `N` is in the range of `[1, 1000]`
2. Do not use class member/global/static variables to store states. Your serialize and deserialize algorithms should be stateless.



### 2. Solution

To serialize/deserialize a n-ary tree into a string, my intuition is to modify our solution of bi-nary tree. 

**Pre-order Traversal \(DFS\) + Queue**

Since preOrder of binary trees means we visit tree nodes in the order recursively: root -&gt; leftChild -&gt; rightChild, in the recursion of deserialization, the first value we see is always a "root" for current sub-tree, except NULL.

In this case of n-ary trees, the preOrder would be: root -&gt; children \(from left to right\)

=&gt; still use Queue\(First-In-First-Out\) to keep the order

The problem is we cannot use NULL/ special char as place holders because we cannot predict the size of children.

=&gt; add an entry as size of children after each node val in serialization + use as for loop limit in deserialization:

{% hint style="info" %}
* Time: O\(n\)  

where n represents the amount of nodes in tree because we need to traverse all nodes and visiting each node takes O\(1\).  N.B.  In serialization, remember to use StringBuilder instead of String so that we make sure each node takes O\(1\) time to update the final result. 

* Space: O\(n\)  

where n represents the amount of nodes in tree. Because in deserialization, the recursion stack would take extra space for all the node if tree is extremely skewed. Also, the Queue of values takes O\(n\) time because each node maps a value.
{% endhint %}



### 3. JAVA Implementation

```text
/*
// Definition for a Node.
class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> children;

    public Node() {}

    public Node(int _val,List<Node> _children) {
        val = _val;
        children = _children;
    }
};
*/
class Codec {

    // Encodes a tree to a single string.
    public String serialize(Node root) {
        if (root == null) {
            return null;
        }
        
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        seHelper(root, sb);
        return sb.toString();
    }
    
    private void seHelper(Node root, StringBuilder sb) {
        if (root == null) {
            return;
        }
        
        sb.append(root.val).append(",");
        sb.append(root.children.size()).append(","); // record the size of children
        for (Node child: root.children) {
            seHelper(child, sb);
        }
    }

    // Decodes your encoded data to tree.
    public Node deserialize(String data) {
        if (data == null) {
            return null;
        }
        
        Queue<String> q = new LinkedList<>();
        String[] vals = data.split(",");
        for (String s: vals) {
            q.offer(s);
        }
        
        return deHelper(q);
    }
    
    private Node deHelper(Queue<String> q) {
        if (q.isEmpty()) {
            return null;
        }
        
        int value = Integer.parseInt(q.poll());
        int childrenSize = Integer.parseInt(q.poll());
        
        Node root = new Node();
        root.val = value;
        List<Node> list = new LinkedList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < childrenSize; i++) {
            list.add(deHelper(q));
        }
        root.children = list;
        
        return root;
    }
}

// Your Codec object will be instantiated and called as such:
// Codec codec = new Codec();
// codec.deserialize(codec.serialize(root));
```
