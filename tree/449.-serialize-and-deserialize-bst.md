# 449. Serialize and Deserialize BST

### 1.[ Description](https://leetcode.com/problems/serialize-and-deserialize-bst/description/)

Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a **binary search tree**. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary search tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

**The encoded string should be as compact as possible.**

**Note:** Do not use class member/global/static variables to store states. Your serialize and deserialize algorithms should be stateless.



### 2. Solution

To serialize the tree into a string, my intuition is to traverse it in some order. 

So to determine traverse in what order, we have to think about how can we deserialize the string back to a tree:

Generally speaking, if I want to build a tree, there are 2 key features I need to figure out:

* tree structure \(i.e. at what position it's a real node, at what position it's a null\)
* node value, i.e. if a node exists at an exact position, what's it value

Since we are asked to build a tree from one string, there is one more thing we should consider:

* how can we get all the valid values from the string, i.e. the "invalid" separator among valid tree node values

Therefore, I first think about level-order traversal. 

**2.1 Level-order Traversal**

Pros:

* straight-forward to understand and implement

Cons:

* not compressed enough -&gt; waste of space

{% hint style="info" %}
* Time: O\(n\)  

where n represents the amount of nodes in tree. After all, traversal means visit all the nodes in the tree.

* Space: O\(2 ^ n\)  

where n represents the amount of nodes in tree. Because we record it as a complete binary tree, so extra space is required for each node on each level.
{% endhint %}

**2.2 InOrder \(BST feature\) + PreOrder/PostOrder Traversal**

Since BST has the unique feature: leftChild.val &lt; root.val &lt; rightChild.val

BST actually contains implicit inOrder traversal result: an ascending array.

Since we know that we can build a tree by InOrder + Pre/PostOrder traversal \(ref: Leetcode problems\), we can deserialize a string if we serialize by Pre/PostOrder Traversal.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Complexity:**

* Time: O\(n\)  

  where n represents the amount of nodes in tree.

* Space: O\(n\)  

  where n represents the amount of nodes in tree. 
{% endhint %}



### 3. JAVA Implementation

3.1 PreOrder Traversal

```text
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
public class Codec {

    // Encodes a tree to a single string.
    public String serialize(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) {
            return null;
        }
        
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        seHelper(root, sb);
        sb.deleteCharAt(sb.length() - 1); // remember the API
        return sb.toString();
    }
    
    private void seHelper(TreeNode root, StringBuilder sb) {
        if (root == null) {
            return;
        }
        
        sb.append(root.val).append(',');
        seHelper(root.left, sb);
        seHelper(root.right, sb);
    }

    
    // Decodes your encoded data to tree.
    public TreeNode deserialize(String data) {
        if (data == null) {
            return null;
        }
        
        Queue<Integer> q = new LinkedList<>();
        String[] strs = data.split(","); // use string ",", not char ','
        for (String s: strs) {
            int val = Integer.parseInt(s);
            q.offer(val);
        }
        
        return deHelper(q, Integer.MIN_VALUE, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
    }
    
    private TreeNode deHelper(Queue<Integer> q, int lower, int upper) {
        if (q.isEmpty()) {
            return null;
        }
        
        int nodeVal = q.peek();
        if (nodeVal < lower || nodeVal > upper) {
            return null;
        }
        
        q.poll();
        TreeNode root = new TreeNode(nodeVal);
        root.left = deHelper(q, lower, nodeVal);
        root.right = deHelper(q, nodeVal, upper);
        
        return root;
    }
}

// Your Codec object will be instantiated and called as such:
// Codec codec = new Codec();
// codec.deserialize(codec.serialize(root));
```
