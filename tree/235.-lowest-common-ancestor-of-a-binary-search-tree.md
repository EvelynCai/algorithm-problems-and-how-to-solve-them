# 235. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree

### 1. [Description](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-search-tree/description/)

Given a binary search tree \(BST\), find the lowest common ancestor \(LCA\) of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the [definition of LCA on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor): “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants \(where we allow **a node to be a descendant of itself**\).”

Given binary search tree:  root = \[6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5\]

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/14/binarysearchtree_improved.png)

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8
Output: 6
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
```

**Assumptions:**

* All of the nodes' values will be unique.
* p and q are different and both values will exist in the BST.



### 2. Solution

1. Binary Search Tree is a binary tree whose tree node values: **left child &lt; root &lt; right child**

N.B. according to Assumption1, all values are unique.

    2. To find the LCA of 2 nodes in the tree \(Assumption2\), we can use the value order in top-down traversal: 

* root == null, i.e. nothing to do =&gt; return itself
* root.val &gt; both target val, i.e. both target nodes must be in our current left sub-tree =&gt; look for them from left child
* root.val &lt; both target val, i.e. both target nodes must be in our current right sub-tree =&gt; look for them from right child
* the rest cases means current root itself is the LCA

To implement, we can either use recursion or iteration:

* recursion: continue looking for LCA by passing left/right child in the same function call

{% hint style="info" %}
**Complexity:**

* Time: O\(n\)  

where n represents the amount of tree nodes. In the worst case, we should traverse all the nodes in the tree.

* Space: O\(n\) 

In the worst case, the tree structure is like a linked list. So the call stack has to store all the n node values in recursion calls.
{% endhint %}

* iteration: use while loop and change the curr node to its left/right child

{% hint style="info" %}
**Complexity:**

* Time: O\(n\)  

where n represents the amount of tree nodes. In the worst case, we should traverse all the nodes in the tree.

* Space: O\(1\) 

Only takes constant extra space to finish the while loop.
{% endhint %}

### 3. JAVA Implementation

1. Recursion

```text
public TreeNode lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
    if (root == null) {
        return root;
    }
        
    if (root.val > p.val && root.val > q.val) {
        return lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q);
    }
        
    if (root.val < p.val && root.val < q.val) {
        return lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q);
    }
        
    return root;
}
```

     2. Iteration

```text
public TreeNode lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
    TreeNode curr = root; // keep track of the original root
    while (curr != null) {
        if (curr.val < p.val && curr.val < q.val) {
            curr = curr.right;
        } else if (curr.val > p.val && curr.val > q.val) {
            curr = curr.left;
        } else {
            return curr;
        }
    }
    
    return root;
}
```
