# 617. Merge Two Binary Tress

### 1. [Description](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-binary-trees/description/)

Given two binary trees and imagine that when you put one of them to cover the other, some nodes of the two trees are overlapped while the others are not.

You need to merge them into a new binary tree. The merge rule is that if two nodes overlap, then sum node values up as the new value of the merged node. Otherwise, the NOT null node will be used as the node of new tree.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: 
	Tree 1                     Tree 2                  
          1                         2                             
         / \                       / \                            
        3   2                     1   3                        
       /                           \   \                      
      5                             4   7                  
Output: 
Merged tree:
	     3
	    / \
	   4   5
	  / \   \ 
	 5   4   7
```

**Note:** The merging process must start from the root nodes of both trees.



### 2. Solution

To handle this problem, we can start from ONE TreeNode ONLY.

If we want to create a newNode according to two nodes, node1 and node2:

* if node1 == null && node2 == null -&gt; nothing needs to be created -&gt; return null
* else if node1 == null \|\| node2 == null -&gt; just create the new node identical to the NOT null node:
  * newNode.val = nonNull.val
  * newNode.left = buildNewNode\(nonNull.left, null\);
  * newNode.right = buildNewNode\(nonNull.right, null\);
* otherwise \(both are NOT null\), create the new node by combining every attribute of both nodes, i.e.:
  * newNode.val = n1.val + n2.val
  * newNode.left = buildNewNode\(n1.left, n2.left\)
  * newNode.right = buildNewNode\(n1.right, n2.right\)
* finally return the created newNode

{% hint style="info" %}
**Complexity:**

* Time: O\(Math.max\(n1 + n2\)\)  

where n1, n2 represents the amount of nodes in tree1 and tree2, separately. In fact, we are traversing all the nodes in both tree.

* Space: O\(Math.max\(n1 + n2\)\)  

where n1, n2 represents the amount of nodes in tree1 and tree2, separately. In the worst case, our recursion call stack have to store all the nodes in the larger tree if it's skewed as a linked list.

### 3. JAVA Implementation

```text
public class TreeNode {
     int val;
     TreeNode left;
     TreeNode right;
     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
}

public TreeNode mergeTrees(TreeNode t1, TreeNode t2) {
        TreeNode newNode = null;
        if (t1 == null && t2 == null) {
            return newNode;
        } else if (t1 == null) {
            newNode = new TreeNode(t2.val);
            newNode.left = mergeTrees(t1, t2.left);
            newNode.right = mergeTrees(t1, t2.right);
        } else if (t2 == null) {
            newNode = new TreeNode(t1.val);
            newNode.left = mergeTrees(t1.left, t2);
            newNode.right = mergeTrees(t1.right, t2);
        } else {
            newNode = new TreeNode(t1.val + t2.val);
            newNode.left = mergeTrees(t1.left, t2.left);
            newNode.right = mergeTrees(t1.right, t2.right);
        }
        
        return newNode;
}
```
