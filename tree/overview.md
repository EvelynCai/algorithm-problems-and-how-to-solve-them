# Overview

### WHAT

**Trick: base case usually refers to the null ChildNode below the leaf node.**

* **Balanced binary tree:** is commonly defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the left and right subtrees of **every** node differ by 1 or less.
* **Complete binary tree:** is a binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible.
* **Binary Search tree:** for every node in the tree, the values in its left subtree are all smaller than its value, and the values in its right subtree are all larger than its value.
