# 236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree

### 1. [Description](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-search-tree/description/)

Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor \(LCA\) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the [definition of LCA on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor): “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants \(where we allow **a node to be a descendant of itself**\).”

Given the following binary tree:  root = \[3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4\]

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/14/binarytree.png)

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
Output: 3
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4
Output: 5
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
```

**Assumptions:**

* All of the nodes' values will be unique.
* p and q are different and both values will exist in the binary tree.



### 2. Solution

Since it's a tree problem, I'd try to form a solution from a recursive point of view and see where I can get:

* if current node is null -&gt; return null
* if current node is one of the target nodes \(compare their values based on Assumption 1\) -&gt; return current node because I've found something
* otherwise:
  * run LCA from left child to get a result, leftResult
  * run LCA from right child to get another result, rightResult
  * determine what to return:
    * if leftResult is a target && rightResult is another target -&gt; current node is exactly the LCA -&gt; return current node
    * if leftResult/rightResult is one of the targets -&gt; one node must be the child of another node \(Assumption 2\) -&gt; return the leftResult/rightResult
    * if nothing could be found from both children -&gt; not possible in this case according to Assumption 2

{% hint style="info" %}
**Complexity:**

* Time: O\(n\)  

where n represents the amount of tree nodes. In the worst case, we should traverse all the nodes in the tree.

* Space: O\(n\) 

In the worst case, the tree structure is like a linked list. So the call stack has to store all the n node values in recursion calls.

### 3. JAVA Implementation

1. Recursion

```text
public class TreeNode {
     int val;
     TreeNode left;
     TreeNode right;
     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
}

public TreeNode lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
    if (root == null || root.val == p.val || root.val == q.val) {
        return root;
    }
        
    TreeNode leftResult = lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q);
    TreeNode rightResult = lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q);
    
    if (leftResult == null) {
        return rightResult;
    } else if (rightResult == null) {
        return leftResult;
    } else {
        return root;
    }
}
```



### 4. Extension

* what if target nodes may not exist in the tree?

```text
public class TreeNode {
     int val;
     TreeNode left;
     TreeNode right;
     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
}

public TreeNode lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
    if (root == null || root.val == p.val || root.val == q.val) {
        return root;
    }
        
    TreeNode leftResult = lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q);
    TreeNode rightResult = lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q);
    
    if (leftResult == null && rightResult == null) {
        return null; // both not exist for sure
    } else if (rightResult != null && leftResult != null) {
        return root; // both are found and from both side -> root is LCA for sure
    }
    
    // only one target is found
    TreeNode found = leftResult == null ? rightResult : leftResult;
    TreeNode notFound = p.val == found.val ? p : q;
    boolean result = search(notFound, found);
    return result ? found : null;
}

private boolean search(TreeNode target, TreeNode root) {
    if (root == null) {
        return false;
    }
    
    if (root.val == target.val) {
        return true;
    }
    
    TreeNode left = search(target, root.left);
    TreeNode right = search(target, root.right);
    return left || right;
}
```

* what if tree is n-ary instead of binary?
* what if we want to find n nodes instead of 2 nodes?
