# 589. N-ary Tree Preorder Traversal

### 1. [Description](https://leetcode.com/problems/n-ary-tree-preorder-traversal/description/)

Given an n-ary tree, return the preorder traversal of its nodes' values.

For example, given a `3-ary` tree:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/12/narytreeexample.png)

Return its preorder traversal as: `[1,3,5,6,2,4]`.

**Note:**

Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?  


### 2. Solution

Preorder traversal means we traverse all the nodes in this tree with the order: root -&gt; all childre

**2.1 Recursion**

When looking at each node in this tree, determine: 

* if root is null -&gt; nothing to do -&gt; return;
* otherwise:
  * add the value of root in result list
  * recursive call to its children

{% hint style="info" %}
* Time: O\(n\)  

where n represents the amount of nodes in tree. After all, traversal means visit all the nodes in the tree.

* Space: O\(n\)  

where n represents the amount of nodes in tree. In the worst case, the recursion call stack has to store all the nodes if it's skewed as a linked list.
{% endhint %}

**2.2 Iteration**

Based on binary solution, we could solve it iteratively by maintaining our explicit "call stack":

* If root is null -&gt; return empty list
* otherwise, push it to stack
* While the stack is not empty:
  * pop the top of stack as root
  * add root.val in the result list
  * since stack is First-In-Last-Out, we should get root's children and reverse their order in childrenList
  * push all nodes in childrenList to stack

{% hint style="info" %}
**Complexity:**

* Time: O\(n\)  

  where n represents the amount of nodes in tree. After all, traversal means visit all the nodes in the tree.

* Space: O\(n\)  

  where n represents the amount of nodes in tree. In the worst case, the stack has to store all the nodes if it's skewed as a linked list.

### 3. JAVA Implementation

Solution 1: recursion

```text
// Definition for a Node.
class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> children;

    public Node() {}

    public Node(int _val,List<Node> _children) {
        val = _val;
        children = _children;
    }
}

public List<Integer> preorder(Node root) {
        List<Integer> res = new ArrayList<>();
        dfs(root, res);
        return res;
}
    
private void dfs(Node root, List<Integer> res) {
        if (root == null) {
            return;
        }
        
        res.add(root.val);
        for (Node n: root.children) {
            dfs(n, res);
        }
}

```

Solution 2: iteration

```text
public List<Integer> preorder(Node root) {
        List<Integer> res = new ArrayList<>();
        // dfs(root, res);
        if (root == null) {
            return res;
        }
        
        Stack<Node> stack = new Stack<>();
        stack.push(root);
        while (!stack.isEmpty()) {
            root = stack.pop();
            res.add(root.val);
            List<Node> cList = root.children;
            Collections.reverse(cList);
            for (Node n: cList) {
                stack.push(n);
            }
        }
        
        return res;
}
```
