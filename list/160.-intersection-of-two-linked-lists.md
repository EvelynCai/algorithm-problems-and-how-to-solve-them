# 160. Intersection of Two Linked Lists

### 1. [Description](https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-linked-lists/description/)

Write a program to find the node at which the intersection of two singly linked lists begins.

For example, the following two linked lists:[![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/13/160_statement.png)](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/13/160_statement.png)

begin to intersect at node c1.

**Example 1:**[![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/13/160_example_1.png)](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/13/160_example_1.png)

```text
Input: intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,0,1,8,4,5], skipA = 2, skipB = 3
Output: Reference of the node with value = 8
Input Explanation: The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect). From the head of A, it reads as [4,1,8,4,5]. From the head of B, it reads as [5,0,1,8,4,5]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.
```

**Example 2:**[![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/13/160_example_2.png)](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/13/160_example_2.png)

```text
Input: intersectVal = 2, listA = [0,9,1,2,4], listB = [3,2,4], skipA = 3, skipB = 1
Output: Reference of the node with value = 2
Input Explanation: The intersected node's value is 2 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect). From the head of A, it reads as [0,9,1,2,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [3,2,4]. There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 1 node before the intersected node in B.
```

**Example 3:**[![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/13/160_example_3.png)](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/13/160_example_3.png)

```text
Input: intersectVal = 0, listA = [2,6,4], listB = [1,5], skipA = 3, skipB = 2
Output: null
Input Explanation: From the head of A, it reads as [2,6,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [1,5]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.
Explanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null.
```

**Notes:**

* If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return `null`.
* The linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns.
* You may assume there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.
* Your code should preferably run in O\(n\) time and use only O\(1\) memory.



### 2. Solution

Suppose there is an intersection between the 2 lists, there must be some nodes in common if we iterate the 2 lists.

Suppose the 2 lists are not identical, there must be something different between the 2 lists.

If we could "erase" the difference when iterating the two lists, we could identify the nodes in common, i.e. the intersection part.

So the key is to merge the 2 lists while iterating.

For example, 

a1 -&gt; a2 -&gt; c1 -&gt; c2 -&gt; c3  ----------&gt; b1 -&gt; b2 -&gt; b3 -&gt; **c1** -&gt; c2 -&gt; c3

b1 -&gt; b2 -&gt; b3 -&gt; c1 -&gt; c2 -&gt; c3 -----------&gt; a1 -&gt; a2 -&gt; **c1** -&gt; c2 -&gt; c3 

The difference will be "erased" after merging listA/listB with listB/listA.

After iterating 

* the different part 1 + common part + different part2
* the different part 2 + common part + difference part1

what's left must be another common part, i.e. the intersection part \(if any\)

{% hint style="info" %}
**Complexity:**

* Time: O\(m + n\)  

where m, n represents the size of listA and listB.

* Space: O\(1\) 

because we are not using extra space except the pointers for iteration.

### 3. JAVA Implementation

```text
public ListNode getIntersectionNode(ListNode headA, ListNode headB) {
    // Solution 1: merge
    ListNode a = headA;
    ListNode b = headB;
    while (a != b) {
        a = a == null ? headB : a.next;
        b = b == null ? headA : b.next;
    }
        
    return a;
    
    // Solution 2: count the length & "cut" the longer list
    /*
    int lenA = count(headA);
    int lenB = count(headB);
    while (lenA > lenB) {
        headA = headA.next;
        lenA--;
    }
    while (lenB > lenA) {
        headB = headB.next;
        lenB--;
    }
    while (headA != null && headB != null) {
        if (headA == headB) {
            return headA;
        }
            
        headA = headA.next;
        headB = headB.next;
    }
        
    return null;
    */
}
```
