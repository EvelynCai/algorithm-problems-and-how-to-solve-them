# 234. Palindrome Linked List

### 1. [Description](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-linked-list/description/)

Given a singly linked list, determine if it is a palindrome.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: 1->2
Output: false
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: 1->2->2->1
Output: true
```

**Follow up:**  
Could you do it in O\(n\) time and O\(1\) space?



### 2. Solution

To define a palindrome, I'd like to divide the linked list into 2 parts from its mid point and compare the 2 parts. 

Since this is a singly linked list, it's hard to iterate from right to left, which makes the following comparison hard by using 2 pointers. Reversing any of the part and compare the two could help.

So, to sum up:

* find the mid point to divide the list into 2 halves
* reverse the second half
* use 2 pointers to compare the two halves until either of them is null
  * if the values they refer to are not equal -&gt; the whole list can't be a palindrome -&gt; return false
  * otherwise, continue
* return true

**Complexity:**

* Time: O\(n\)  

where n represents the amount of list nodes. 

* Space: O\(1\)

### 3. JAVA Implementation

```text
public boolean isPalindrome(ListNode head) {
    if (head == null || head.next == null) {
        return true;
    }
    
    ListNode mid = getMid(head);
    
    mid = reverse(mid);
    
    while (head != null && mid != null) {
        if (head.val != mid.val) {
            return false;
        }
        head = head.next;
        mid = mid.next;
    }
    
    return true;
}

private ListNode getMid(ListNode head) {
    ListNode fast = head;
    while (fast != null && fast.next != null) {
        fast = fast.next.next;
        head = head.next;
    }
    
    return head;
}

private ListNode reverse(ListNode head) {
    if (head == null || head.next == null) {
        return head;
    }
    
    ListNode tmpNext = head.next;
    ListNode newHead = reverse(head.next);
    tmpNext.next = head;
    head.next = null;
    
    return newHead;    
}
```



### 4. Comments

* This problem is a sophisticated combination of finding mid point, reversing linked lists and comparing 2 lists.
