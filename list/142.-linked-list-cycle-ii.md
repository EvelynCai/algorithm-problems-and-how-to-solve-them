# 142. Linked List Cycle II

### 1. [Description](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/description/)

### Given a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return `null`.

To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer `pos` which represents the position \(0-indexed\) in the linked list where tail connects to. If `pos` is `-1`, then there is no cycle in the linked list.

**Note:** Do not modify the linked list.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: tail connects to node index 1
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: tail connects to node index 0
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: no cycle
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.

Can you solve it without using extra space?  


### 2. Solution

To identify cycles in a linked list, we may use 2 pointers moving at different speed:

* If there is a cycle in the list, the pointers will finally meet at one point. 
* otherwise, the faster pointer will hit the end \(null\) at last, therefore, the list cannot contain a cycle.

But if there is a cycle, the problem follows up: how to find the point where the cycle starts?

As illustrated, if we use 2 pointers: `slow` and `fast` which move 1 and 2 steps each time from start.

`slow` movements at first intersection = F + a

`fast` movements at first intersection \(after 1 cycle\) = F + a + b + a

Since within the same amount time, their relationships: `fast` movements =  2 \* `slow` movements

2 \(F + a\) = F + a + b + a

F = b

So, to find the cycle entrance, we just need F, i.e. b steps from their first interaction:

* keep `slow` at it place, i.e. first intersection \(node h\)
* put `fast` back to start, i.e. node -F
* let them move forward 1 step a time until meet, where `fast` moves F = `slow` moves b

And the place their meet again will be the cycle entrance.

**Complexity:**

* Time: O\(n\)  

where n represents the size of list. 

If there is no cycle, we will iterate the entire list, which take O\(n\) time. 

If there is a cycle, we will have several loops of iteration to make the fast meet the slow pointer. Followed by a few more steps as iteration to find out the "entry" point of cycle. Overall, it takes O\(n\) time.

* Space: O\(1\) 

because we are not using extra space except the fast and slow pointers.

### 3. JAVA Implementation

```text
public ListNode detectCycle(ListNode head) {
        if (head == null || head.next == null) {
            return null;
        }
        
        ListNode fast = head;
        ListNode slow = head;
        while (fast != null && fast.next != null) {
            fast = fast.next.next;
            slow = slow.next;
            if (slow == fast) {
                break;
            }
        }
        
        if (fast == null || fast.next == null) {
            return null;
        }
        
        fast = head;
        while (fast != slow) {
            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next;
        }
        
        return slow;
}
```
