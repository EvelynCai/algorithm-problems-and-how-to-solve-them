# 876. Middle of the Linked List

### 1.[ Description](https://leetcode.com/problems/middle-of-the-linked-list/)

Given a non-empty, singly linked list with head node `head`, return a middle node of linked list.

If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: Node 3 from this list (Serialization: [3,4,5])
The returned node has value 3.  (The judge's serialization of this node is [3,4,5]).
Note that we returned a ListNode object ans, such that:
ans.val = 3, ans.next.val = 4, ans.next.next.val = 5, and ans.next.next.next = NULL.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: Node 4 from this list (Serialization: [4,5,6])
Since the list has two middle nodes with values 3 and 4, we return the second one.
```

**Note:**

* The number of nodes in the given list will be between `1` and `100`.



### 2. Solution

Fast & Slow Pointers

* corner case: 0 or 1 nodes in list
* `fast` pointer: moves 2 steps forward a time
* `slow` pointer: moves 1 step forward a time
* when `fast` hits the end/null, `slow` will be in the middle

{% hint style="info" %}
**Complexity:**

* Time: O\(n\)  

where n represents the size of linked list. Because the `fast` pointer actually iterates the entire list to make `slow` get to middle.

* Space: O\(1\) 

because we used constant extra space for the two pointers
{% endhint %}



### 3. JAVA Implementation

```text
public ListNode middleNode(ListNode head) {
    if (head == null || head.next == null) {
        return head;
    }
        
    ListNode fast = head;
    ListNode slow = head;
    while (fast != null && fast.next != null) {
        slow = slow.next;
        fast = fast.next.next;
    }
        
    return slow;
}
```
