# 21. Merge Two Sorted Lists

### 1. [Description](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/description/)

Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a new list. The new list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

**Example:**

```text
Input: 1->2->4, 1->3->4
Output: 1->1->2->3->4->4
```

### 

### 2. Solution

To merge 2 linked lists which are sorted, the key is to always compare 2 list heads and fetch the smaller one. However, this means we have to initiate our own "overall list" by:

* creating a dummy head
* save a copy of dummy head to use in final result
* when 2 list heads are all not null, compare 2 list head vals:
  * append whichever is smaller to dummy's next
  * move the list head which is appended forward
  * move the dummy forward
* check if 2 list head are all null:
  * if any of them is not null, append it to dummy's next
* return the next of dummy head copied at beginning

**Complexity:**

* Time: O\(m + n\)  

where m represents the size of list1 and n represents the size of list2. In essence, we have to traverse both lists.

* Space: O\(1\) 

because we are not using extra space except the dummy and its copy.

### 3. JAVA Implementation

```text
public ListNode mergeTwoLists(ListNode l1, ListNode l2) {
        ListNode dummy = new ListNode(0);
        ListNode head = dummy;
        while (l1 != null && l2 != null) {
            if (l1.val < l2.val) {
                head.next = l1;
                l1 = l1.next;
            } else {
                head.next = l2;
                l2 = l2.next;
            }
            
            head = head.next;
        }
        
        if (l1 != null) {
            head.next = l1;
        } else if (l2 != null) {
            head.next = l2;
        }
        
        return dummy.next;
    }
}
```
