# 19. Remove Nth Node From End of List

### 1. [Description](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list/)

Given a linked list, remove the _n_-th node from the end of list and return its head.

**Example:**

```text
Given linked list: 1->2->3->4->5, and n = 2.

After removing the second node from the end, the linked list becomes 1->2->3->5.
```

**Note:**

Given _n_ will always be valid.

**Follow up:**

Could you do this in one pass?

### 

### 2. Solution

If we could assume n is always valid, then we could iterate the singly linked list in one pass with 3 pointers:

* `fast`: move n steps in advance 
* `slow`: the node to be removed, starts from head with a distance to `fast` = n, i.e. when fast hits the end null in the one-pass iteration, `slow` points to the node to be removed
* `prev`: the previous node of `slow`, for easier operation of removal

In the one-pass iteration, 

* `fast` moves forward n steps from head
* `slow` moves forward from head, with `fast` move one step a time as well
* `prev` starts from null, as the previous node of `slow` and move one step a time along 
* when `fast` hits the end null, `slow` is the node to be removed:
  * if `prev` = null, i.e. slow is still head -&gt; just return low.next
  * if  `prev` != null, remove `slow` by pointing the next pointer of `prev` to the next node of `slow`

**Complexity:**

* Time: O\(n\)  

where n represents the size of linked list. Overall, it's a one-pass iteration.

* Space: O\(1\) 

only takes constant extra space.

### 3. JAVA Implementation

```text
public ListNode removeNthFromEnd(ListNode head, int n) {
    if (head == null || n < 1) {
        return head;
    } 
        
    ListNode fast = head;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        fast = fast.next;
    }
        
    ListNode prev = null;
    ListNode slow = head;
    while (fast != null) {
        prev = slow;
        slow = slow.next;
        fast = fast.next;
    }
        
    if (prev == null) {
        return slow.next;
    } 
        
    prev.next = slow.next;
    return head;
} 
```



### 4. Comments

* Key point of singly linked list node removal: always keep track of the previous node to operate
* Edge case: 
  * if the node to be removed is the head, return head.next directly
  * if head == null, return null directly
