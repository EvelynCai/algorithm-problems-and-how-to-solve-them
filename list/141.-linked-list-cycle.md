# 141. Linked List Cycle

### 1. [Description](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/description/)

Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it.

To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer `pos` which represents the position \(0-indexed\) in the linked list where tail connects to. If `pos` is `-1`, then there is no cycle in the linked list.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: false
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
```

**Follow up:**

Can you solve it using _O\(1\)_ \(i.e. constant\) memory?  


### 2. Solution

To identify cycles in a linked list, we may use 2 pointers moving at different speed:

* If there is a cycle in the list, the pointers will finally meet at one point. 
* otherwise, the faster pointer will hit the end at last, therefore, the list cannot contain a cycle.

**Complexity:**

* Time: O\(n\)  

where n represents the size of list.

* Space: O\(1\) 

because we are not using extra space except the fast and slow pointers.
{% endhint %}



### 3. JAVA Implementation

```text
public boolean hasCycle(ListNode head) {
    ListNode slow = head;
    ListNode fast = head;
    while (fast != null && fast.next != null) {
        fast = fast.next.next;
        slow = slow.next;
        if (slow == fast) {
            return true;
        }
    }
        
    return false;
}
```
