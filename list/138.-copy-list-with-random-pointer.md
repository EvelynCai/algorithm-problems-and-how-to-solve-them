# 138. Copy List with Random Pointer

### 1.[ Description](https://leetcode.com/problems/copy-list-with-random-pointer/description/)

A linked list is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer which could point to any node in the list or null.

Return a [**deep copy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_copying#Deep_copy) of the list.

**Example 1:**

![](https://discuss.leetcode.com/uploads/files/1470150906153-2yxeznm.png)

```text
Input:
{"$id":"1","next":{"$id":"2","next":null,"random":{"$ref":"2"},"val":2},"random":{"$ref":"2"},"val":1}

Explanation:
Node 1's value is 1, both of its next and random pointer points to Node 2.
Node 2's value is 2, its next pointer points to null and its random pointer points to itself.
```

**Note:**

1. You must return the **copy of the given head** as a reference to the cloned list.



### 2. Solution

To implement the deep copy, we need to make sure new list nodes always point to new list nodes. Therefore a map &lt;oldNode, newNode&gt; should be maintained:

* iterate the original list to populate the old-new node map by constructing new node with values only
* iterate the original list to assign/point the next & random pointer to the mapped new node

{% hint style="info" %}
**Complexity:**

* Time: O\(n\)  

where n represents the size of list.

* Space: O\(n\) 

because we maintain a map to match all the old-new nodes.
{% endhint %}



### 3. JAVA Implementation

```text
public Node copyRandomList(Node head) {
	Map<Node, Node> map = new HashMap<>();
	Node headCopy = head;
    Node headCopy2 = head;
	while (head != null) {
		Node newNode = new Node(head.val, null, null);
        map.put(head, newNode);
		head = head.next;
     }
 
     while (headCopy != null) {
            Node newNode = map.get(headCopy);
            newNode.next = map.get(headCopy.next);
            newNode.random = map.get(headCopy.random);
            headCopy = headCopy.next;
     }
 
     return map.get(headCopy2);
}
```
