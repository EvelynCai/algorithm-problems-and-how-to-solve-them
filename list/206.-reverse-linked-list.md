# 206. Reverse Linked List

### 1. [Description](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/description/)

Reverse a singly linked list.

**Example:**

```text
Input: 1->2->3->4->5->NULL
Output: 5->4->3->2->1->NULL
```

**Follow up:**

A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or recursively. Could you implement both?



### 2. Solution

Recursion

* base case: there is only 0 / 1 node in the list
* recursive call: apply the recursion to the next node and get the overall reversed head
* actions taken at current node:
  * point next node's pointer back to current node
  * cut current node's pointer to get rid of loops

{% hint style="info" %}
**Complexity:**

* Time: O\(n\)  

where n represents the amount of list nodes. After all, we have to traverse the entire list to reverse nodes one by one.

* Space: O\(n\) 

where n represents the amount of list nodes. The recursion call stack will take extra space store all the nodes from start until it hits the end.
{% endhint %}

Iteration

{% hint style="info" %}
**Complexity:**

* Time: O\(n\)  

where n represents the amount of list nodes. After all, we have to traverse the entire list to reverse nodes one by one.

* Space: O\(1\) 

because iteration is not taking extra space except the temporary node to keep track of next node.
{% endhint %}



### 3. JAVA Implementation

3.1 Recursion

```text
public ListNode reverseList(ListNode head) {
    // bottom line: 0 or 1 node in list
    if (head == null || head.next == null) {
        return head;
    }
    
    // get the final result by passing next node
    ListNode result = reverseList(head.next);
        
    // take actions to reverse current&next pointer
    head.next.next = head;
    head.next = null;
    
    return result;
}
```

3.2 Iteration

```text
public ListNode reverseList(ListNode head) {
    ListNode prev = null;
    while (head != null) {
            // take actions to reverse current pointer
            ListNode nextNode = head.next;
            head.next = prev;
            
            // move prev & current node forward
            prev = head;
            head = nextNode;
    }
        
    // terminate while loop when head is null, so result will be prev
    return prev;
}
```
