# 292. Nim Game

### 1. [Problem:](https://leetcode.com/problems/nim-game/solution/) 

You are playing the following Nim Game with your friend: There is a heap of stones on the table, each time one of you take turns to remove 1 to 3 stones. The one who removes the last stone will be the winner. You will take the first turn to remove the stones.

Both of you are very clever and have optimal strategies for the game. Write a function to determine whether you can win the game given the number of stones in the heap.

**Example:**

```text
Input: 4
Output: false 
Explanation: If there are 4 stones in the heap, then you will never win the game;
             No matter 1, 2, or 3 stones you remove, the last stone will always be 
             removed by your friend.
```

### **2. Analysis:** 

According to Game Playing Chapter, Nim is Impartial Game under Misere Winning Strategy.

if player1 is optimizing his move, its result depends on whether next game position \(player2\) can win:

* if any next game position cannot win: player1 will take this move -&gt; player1 can win
* if all the next game position can win: player2 will always win -&gt; player1 cannot win

### 3. Solution:

**Solution 1: Dynamic Programming**

**Complexity**

1. Time: O\(n\)  

{% hint style="info" %}
Where n represents the input
{% endhint %}

2. Space: O\(n\)

{% hint style="info" %}
It takes extra n space to store whether each position wins from 1 to n. -&gt; Runtime Error: Stack Overflow
{% endhint %}

#### Solution 2: Math

base case: \(as in description\), 

* when n = 4, next position/the opponent will always win -&gt; whoever at the position of 4 will lose
* when 4 + 1 / 4 + 2 / 4 + 3 -&gt; next position can always be forced as 4 -&gt; current player can win

induction:

* when n = 4 \* k, the next position will always win -&gt; current player cannot win
* otherwise, next position can be forced to 4 \* k -&gt; next player cannot win

**Complexity**

1. Time: O\(1\)  
2. Space: O\(1\)

### 4. JAVA Implementation:

#### Solution 1 DP: Stack Overflow

```text
public boolean canWinNim(int n) {
    Map<Integer, Boolean> map = new HashMap<>();
    return nStateWins(n, map);
}
    
private boolean nStateWins(int n, Map<Integer, Boolean> map) {
    if (n <= 3) {
        map.put(n, true);
        return true;
    }

    for (int i = 3; i >= 1; i--) {
        boolean nextWins = map.containsKey(n - i) ? map.get(n - i) : nStateWins(n - i, map);
        if (!nextWins) {
            map.put(n, true);
            return true;
        }
    }

    map.put(n, false);
    return false;
}
```

#### Solution 2 Math

```text
public boolean canWinNim(int n) {
    return n % 4 != 0;   
}
```
