# 464. Can I Win

### 1.[ Problem: ](https://leetcode.com/problems/can-i-win/description/)

In the "100 game," two players take turns adding to a running total, any integer from 1..10. The player who first causes the running total to reach or exceed 100 wins.

What if we change the game so that players _cannot re-use integers_?

For example, two players might take turns drawing from a common pool of numbers of 1..15 without replacement until they reach a total &gt;= 100.

Given an integer `maxChoosableInteger` and another integer `desiredTotal`, determine if the first player to move can force a win, assuming both players play optimally.

You can always assume that `maxChoosableInteger` will not be larger than 20 and `desiredTotal` will not be larger than 300.

**Example:**

```text
Input:
maxChoosableInteger = 10
desiredTotal = 11

Output:
false

Explanation:
No matter which integer the first player choose, the first player will lose.
The first player can choose an integer from 1 up to 10.
If the first player choose 1, the second player can only choose integers from 2 up to 10.
The second player will win by choosing 10 and get a total = 11, which is >= desiredTotal.
Same with other integers chosen by the first player, the second player will always win.
```

### **2. Analysis:** 

According to Game Playing Chapter, this game is Impartial Game under General Winning Strategy.

When player1 takes an action, the result depends on whether the following game position \(the status before player2 takes an action\) can win:

* if in any one attempt, player2 cannot win -&gt; player1 will take this move as optimum -&gt; player1 can win
* if of all incoming game position, there will always be win -&gt; player2 will always win -&gt; player1 cannot win

**=&gt; Edge cases:**

* maxChoosableInteger &gt;= desiredTotal -&gt; in first action, player1 can win if he choose any int that is larger than desiredTotal 
* sum of ints in \[1, maxChoosableInteger\] &lt; desiredTotal -&gt; it's not possible to get a win in this game even if all ints are chosen

**=&gt; Assumption1**: **without reuse -&gt; maintain a boolean\[\] to recored if selected**

for each integer num in \[1, maxChoosableInteger\]:

* if num has been selected, skip and continue to next;
* if num has not been selected, 
  * mark num as selected
  * select it as player1's current move and infer next state
    * if next state cannot win -&gt; player2 cannot win =&gt; player1 can force a win =&gt; record the result as &lt;currState, true&gt; -&gt; mark num as unselected and return true;

if all next states can win -&gt; player2 can win anyway-&gt; player1 cannot force a win -&gt; memo as &lt;currState, false&gt; -&gt; mark num as unselected and return false

**=&gt; Assumption2: with reuse**

### 3. Solution:

**Solution: Dynamic Programming**

**Complexity**

1. Time: O\(2 ^ n\)  

{% hint style="info" %}
without memo, the time complexity if O\(n!\)

with memo,  it's reduced to O\(2 ^ n\), where n represents maxChoosableInteger,

-&gt; on each level of DFS tree, the decision is whether to choose one number in \[1, maxChoosableInteger\]

* amount of tree levels = maxChoosableInteger\(n\)
* on each level, the branches is whether to choose one number in \[1, maxChoosableInteger\]
{% endhint %}

2. Space: O\(n\)

{% hint style="info" %}
an array of \(maxChoosableInteger + 1\): mark if the integer has been used

a DP map&lt;Sring, Boolean&gt;: key is a serialized key of a certain state, value is whether this state can win.
{% endhint %}

### 4. JAVA Implementation:

```text
Map<String, Boolean> memo = new HashMap<>();
public boolean canIWin(int maxChoosableInteger, int desiredTotal) {
    if (maxChoosableInteger >= desiredTotal) {
        return true;
    }
        
    if (maxChoosableInteger * (maxChoosableInteger + 1) / 2 < desiredTotal) {
        return false;
    }
        
    boolean[] selected = new boolean[maxChoosableInteger + 1];
    return ifStateWins(maxChoosableInteger, desiredTotal, selected);
}
    
private boolean ifStateWins(int maxChoosableInteger, int desiredTotal, boolean[] selected) {
    if (desiredTotal <= 0) {
        return false;
    }
        
    String key = Arrays.toString(selected);
    if (memo.containsKey(key)) {
        return memo.get(key);
    }
        
    for (int i = 1; i <= maxChoosableInteger; i++) {
        if (selected[i]) {
            continue;
        }
            
        selected[i] = true;
        if (!ifStateWins(maxChoosableInteger, desiredTotal - i, selected)) {
            memo.put(key, true);
            selected[i] = false;
            return true;
        } 
        selected[i] = false;
    }
    memo.put(key, false);
    return false; 
}
```

#### -&gt; Enhancement:

* To get the key of hashmap, we are 
  * converting boolean\[\] to String: using Arrays.toString\(\)
  * converting boolean\[\] to Integer: using bit masks: 0 as unused, 1 as used

```text
private int format(boolean[] used) {
    int res = 0;
    for (boolean u: used) {
        res << 1;
        if (u) {
            res |= 1;
        }
    }
    
    return res;
}
```
