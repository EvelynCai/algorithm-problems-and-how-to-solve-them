# 771. Jewels and Stones

### 1.[ Problem: ](https://leetcode.com/problems/jewels-and-stones/description/)

You're given strings `J` representing the types of stones that are jewels, and `S` representing the stones you have.  Each character in `S`is a type of stone you have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

The letters in `J` are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in `J` and `S` are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so `"a"` is considered a different type of stone from `"A"`.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: J = "aA", S = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: J = "z", S = "ZZ"
Output: 0
```

**Note:**

* `S` and `J` will consist of letters and have length at most 50.
* The characters in `J` are distinct.



### **2. Analysis:** 

The key to this problem is to identify whether a char from one string is contained in another string. So I'm thinking of hash tables:

* iterate J \(jewels\) to put all chars into a hashSet
* iterate S \(stones\) to check if each char is contained in the hashSet of jewels:
  * if contained, increase the result counter
  * if not, continue
* return the result counter

**Complexity:**

{% hint style="info" %}
Time: O\(m + n\)

where m represents the length of string jewels, and n represents the length of string stones. Because we have to iterate both string.

Space: O\(m\)

where m represents the length of string jewels. Because we use extra space of hashSet to store all chars of string jewels.
{% endhint %}



### 3. JAVA Implementation:

```text
public int numJewelsInStones(String J, String S) {
    if (J == null || S == null || J.length() == 0 || S.length() == 0) {
        return 0;
    }
        
    Set<Character> set = new HashSet<>();
    for (char c: J.toCharArray()) {
        set.add(c);
    }
        
    int res = 0;
    for (char s: S.toCharArray()) {
        if (set.contains(s)) {
            res++;
        }
    }
        
    return res;    
}
```
