# 89. Gray Code

### 1. [Problem: ](https://leetcode.com/problems/gray-code/description/)

The gray code is a binary numeral system where two successive values differ in only one bit.

Given a non-negative integer _n_ representing the total number of bits in the code, print the sequence of gray code. A gray code sequence must begin with 0.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: 2
Output: [0,1,3,2]
Explanation:
00 - 0
01 - 1
11 - 3
10 - 2

For a given n, a gray code sequence may not be uniquely defined.
For example, [0,2,3,1] is also a valid gray code sequence.

00 - 0
10 - 2
11 - 3
01 - 1
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: 0
Output: [0]
Explanation: We define the gray code sequence to begin with 0.
             A gray code sequence of n has size = 2n, which for n = 0 the size is 20 = 1.
             Therefore, for n = 0 the gray code sequence is [0]
```



### **2. Analysis:** 

If the input is n, then output size should be 2 ^ n .

Therefore, the output size doubles when input increases from n - 1 to n, i.e. the result of n can be divided into 2 halves:

* the first half is exactly the output when input = n - 1
* the second half is adding a "1" at the beginning of each result of n - 1;

**Complexity:**

{% hint style="info" %}
Time: O\(n ^ 2\)

where n represents the input, because there are 2 for loops in the solution. In worst case, the outer loop run from 0 to n; the inner loop starts from half-n to 0;

Space: O\(1\)

because we are not taking extra space except the result list.
{% endhint %}



### 3. JAVA Implementation:

```text
public List<Integer> grayCode(int n) {
    List<Integer> res = new ArrayList<>();
    res.add(0);
        
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int size = res.size();
        for (int j = size - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
            int tmp = res.get(j) | 1 << i;
            res.add(tmp);
        }
    }
        
    return res;  
}
```
