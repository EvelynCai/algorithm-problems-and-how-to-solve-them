# 1004. Consecutive Ones III

### 1.[ Problem:](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-consecutive-ones-iii/description/) 

Given an array `A` of 0s and 1s, we may change up to `K` values from 0 to 1.

Return the length of the longest \(contiguous\) subarray that contains only 1s. 

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: A = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], K = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: 
[1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1.  The longest subarray is underlined.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: A = [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1], K = 3
Output: 10
Explanation: 
[0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1.  The longest subarray is underlined.
```

**Note:**

1. `1 <= A.length <= 20000`
2. `0 <= K <= A.length`
3. `A[i]` is `0` or `1` 

### **2. Analysis:** 

Sliding Window: marked by 2 pointers

* right: the end of the window, move forward to expand until the window size exceeds all current 1s and  K potential 1s
* left: the start of the window, move forward to shrink until the window size recovers to what K potential 1s could handle.

### 3. Solution:

**Complexity**

1. Time: O\(A.length\) 
2. 2. Space: O\(1\)

### 4. JAVA Implementation:

```text
public int longestOnes(int[] A, int K) {
    int left = 0;
    int right = 0;
    int res = 0;
    int count = 0;
    while (right < A.length) {
        if (A[right] == 1) {
            count++;
        }
        
        right++;
        while (right - left > K + count) {
            if (A[left] == 1) {
                count--;
            }
            left++;
        }
        
        res = Math.max(res, right - left);
    }
    
    return res;
}
```

### 5. Note:

* when to update right determines what's the size of window:
  * right moved forward: window size = right - left;
  * right not moved yet: window size = right - left + 1;
