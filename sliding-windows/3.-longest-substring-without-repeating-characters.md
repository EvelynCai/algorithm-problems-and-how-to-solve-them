# 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

### 1. [Problem: ](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/description/)

Given a string, find the length of the **longest substring** without repeating characters.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: "abcabcbb"
Output: 3 
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3. 
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3. 
             Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```

### **2. Analysis:** 

Sliding Window: 

* desirable window definition: no repeated char
* right: the end of the window, move forward to expand until the window contains a repeated char
* left: the start of the window, move forward to shrink until the window no longer contains the repeated char

iterate the string to check right char:

* not contained in window set: add in window set, update max length, increment right pointer
* contained in window set: remove left char from window set, increment left pointer

#### **=&gt; Things to be clarified**

1. to get max result, compare global\_max and current length as long as right side is updated

### 3. Solution:

**Complexity**

1. Time: O\(s.length\(\)\) 
2. 2. Space: O\(s.length\(\)\)

### 4. JAVA Implementation:

```text
public int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String s) {
    if (s == null || s.length() == 0) {
        return 0;
    }
    
    int left = 0;
    int right = 0;
    int res = 0;
    Set<Character> set = new HashSet<>();
    while (left <= right && right < s.length()) {
        char rChar = s.charAt(right);
        if (!set.contains(rChar)) {
            set.add(rChar);
            res = Math.max(res, right - left + 1);
            right++;
        } else {
            char lChar = s.charAt(left);
            set.remove(lChar);
            left++;
        }
    }
    
    return res;
}
```

### 5. Note:

* While loop condition should limit left &lt;= right to get rid of Time Limit Error
