# Preface

### Thanks for reading!

This is a book of my thoughts on algorithm problems \(mostly from Leetcode\) and how to solve them. 

When I was studying in Carnegie Mellon University, I took a course called _Data Structures for Application Programmers_. The instructor of the course, Terry, impressed me with his master of data structures, and his passion to dive deep into the details. It was at that time that I started to reflect on my attitude on algorithms problems as a candidate of software/application engineer.

I was used to taking the problems, esp. leetcode problems as tasks to accomplish so that I can pass job interviews. However, I didn't think about why most companies consider algorithm problems as the most cost-effective way of talent acquisition. Therefore, I didn't understand what interviewers expect in the following 30-45 minutes when he/she asks me an algorithm problem and thus, what to demonstrate as an interviewee.

So I started to write this book. For one thing, I summarize my thoughts to deepen my knowledge and experience on data structures and algorithms, which is the fundamental skills of software development. For another thing, I inspire myself to reflect on not only "HOW", but also "WHY" so that I can connect these problems with the career development as software engineers.

It'll be a long list even though I'm just starting with basic data structures and algorithms for application engineers. Anyway, I'll make it gradually and review recursively. Hope it can help with my career which starts as a junior software engineer, and if possible, yours as well.
