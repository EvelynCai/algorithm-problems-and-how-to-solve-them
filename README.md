# PREFACE

Hello World! Thanks for reading my gitbook on algorithm problems and how to solve them. 

## WHY
It is a truth universally acknowledged that `Programs = Data Structures + Algorithms`. So solving algorithm problems is a common interview evaluation for software engineer candidates.

However, when I saw the thousands of problems on Online Judgement systems like Leetcode, I didn't have a clue of where to get started and how to deal with them. Fortunately, I took _Data Structures for Application Programmers_ at Carnegie Mellon University. The course instructor, Terry, impressed me with his knowledge in data structures, passion to dive deep, and empowerment of students to solve algorithm problems. 

It was at that time that I decided to note down how I approach the fundamental algorithm problems to become a more solid software engineer. For one thing, I want to summarize my thoughts and thus deepening my understanding. For another thing, I like sharing and giving back to the tech community. I'd be glad and honored if this hands-on gitbook makes a difference to anyone.

By the way, the name is actually originated from "Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them". Hope everyone could enjoy the fun here as in the wizarding world of Harry Potter.

## WHAT

I categorize the contents by basic data structures:
* Array
* LinkedList
* Stack
* Queue
* Heap
* Hash Table
* Tree
* Graph

as well as algorithms:
* Sort
* Search
* Recursion
* Sliding Window
* Dynamic Programming
* Greedy Algorithm

There are some categories for problems of certain types: 
* String
* Bit Manipulation
* Math
* Games
* Design 

The last section summarizes some tips and tricks in Java implementation of solutions.

## HOW

Each chapter starts with an overview.

After the high-level understanding, I dive deep into each specific algorithm (mostly Leetcode) problem with details of:
* problem description, examples, and assumptions
* solutions, complexity analysis, and why
* Java implementation 
* comments, notes or extensions

Reading each chapter and start with its overview is rather independent. Searching problem names also works if you want to be aware of one certain problem quickly.
