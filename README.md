# Preface

### Thanks for reading!

This is a book of my thoughts on algorithm problems \(mostly from Leetcode\) and how to solve them. 

When I was studying in Carnegie Mellon University, I took a course called _Data Structures for Application Programmers_. The instructor of the course, Terry, impressed me with his master of data structures, and his passion to dive deep into the details. It was at that time that I started to reflect on my attitude on algorithms problems as a candidate of software/application engineer.

I was used to taking the problems, esp. Leetcode problems as tasks to accomplish so that I can pass job interviews. And of course, I didn't want to take a second look at them after seeing the "Accept". I practiced them because I held the belief that the candidates who're able to solve such problems during interviews get their desirable jobs. It turned out that I've messed up with the cause and result.

It's not being able to write the bug-free solutions of Leetcode problems that results in offers, but the qualifications demonstrated in solving the Leetcode problems. Therefore, it's important to figure out why most companies consider algorithm problems as the most cost-effective way of talent acquisition. In other words, what interviewers expect in the following 30-45 minutes when he/she asks an algorithm problem.

So I started to write this book. For one thing, I summarize my thoughts to deepen my knowledge and experience on data structures and algorithms, which is the fundamental skills of software development. For another thing, I inspire myself to reflect on not only "HOW", but also "WHY" so that I can connect these problems with the career development as software engineers.

It'll be a long list even though I'm just starting with basic data structures and algorithms for application engineers. Anyway, I'll make it gradually and review recursively. Hope it can help with my career which starts as a junior software engineer, and if possible, yours as well.
